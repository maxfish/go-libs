/**
 * Permutation table. This is just a random jumble of all numbers 0-255.
 *
 * This produce a repeatable pattern of 256, but Ken Perlin stated
 * that it is not a problem for graphic texture as the noise features disappear
 * at a distance far enough to be able to see a repeatable pattern of 256.
 *
 * This needs to be exactly the same for all instances on all platforms,
 * so it's easiest to just keep it as static explicit data.
 * This also removes the need for any initialisation of this class.
 *
 * Note that making this an uint32_t[] instead of a uint8_t[] might make the
 * code run faster on platforms with a high penalty for unaligned single
 * byte addressing. Intel x86 is generally single-byte-friendly, but
 * some other CPUs are faster with 4-aligned reads.
 * However, a char[] is smaller, which avoids cache trashing, and that
 * is probably the most important aspect on most architectures.
 * This array is accessed a *lot* by the noise functions.
 * A vector-valued noise over 3D accesses it 96 times, and a
 * float-valued 4D noise 64 times. We want this to fit in the cache!
